WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CONTROL<13> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:774 - Unexpected DCM configuration. CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT
   is not configured VARIABLE for comp clk_wiz_v3_3_1/dcm_sp_inst. The PSEN pin
   is connected to an active signal. The PSEN pin should be connected to GND to
   guarantee the expected operation.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp
   clk_wiz_v3_3_1/dcm_sp_inst, consult the device Data Sheet.
DRC detected 0 errors and 2 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
